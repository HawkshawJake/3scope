## Carbon Emission Scopes

### Scope 1: Direct Emissions
Direct greenhouse gas emissions from sources owned or controlled by your organization:
- Company-owned vehicles and fleet operations
- On-site fuel combustion (heating, cooling)
- Manufacturing and industrial processes
- Fugitive emissions from refrigeration
- Company-owned facilities and equipment

### Scope 2: Electricity Indirect
Indirect emissions from purchased energy consumed by your organization:
- Purchased electricity for offices and facilities
- Purchased steam for heating
- Purchased heating and cooling systems
- Grid electricity for manufacturing
- Renewable energy certificates (RECs)

### Scope 3: Other Indirect
All other indirect emissions in your value chain:
- Business travel and employee commuting
- Supply chain and purchased goods
- Waste disposal and treatment
- Downstream transportation
- Product use and end-of-life treatment

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
